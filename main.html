  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by the way technology can solve real-world problems and improve lives. Becoming a software developer allows me to turn ideas into working solutions, automate tasks, and build applications that can impact millions. I love the creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning involved in development. It's not just a career pathâ€”it's a way to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the digital world.
